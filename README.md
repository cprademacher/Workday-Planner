# Workday Planner

## Description

- I built this project for users to be able to track their daily tasks throughout the day and be able to know what time of day it is/what task they should be doing.
- It solves time blocking issues to allow users to be more efficient in their day.
- I learned how to better use DOM manipulation, jquery, and local storage.


## Installation

I needed to clone the given starter code from my bootcamp instructors, edit the given code to make the application functional, and finally use GitHub Pages to deploy the application to the web.

## Usage

Users simply need to click on the time-box they want to enter a task for, type whatever task they intend to save, then click the save button.

## Credits

Source code came from the UT Coding Bootcamp Staff


I used chatgpt to ask it how to render text in an element, and then make that text disappear in 2 seconds.
